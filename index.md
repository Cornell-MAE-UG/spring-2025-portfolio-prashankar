## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a third-year undergraduate student studying Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at Cornell University. I am engaged in hands-on projects in and outside of the classroom, including my project team, Cornell Rocketry Team, and my research in the ZT Group. I am also interning at Polamer Precision, an aircraft engine manufacturer in Connecticut. My interest in aerospace began in my childhood with a fascination for aviation; I eventually began tranining for my Private Pilot's License as a cadet in the Cadet Program of Civil Air Patrol, the U.S. Air Force auxiliary. I am currently interested in working in the aerospace/defense industry as an aerospace engineer following my graduation from Cornell in 2027.
