The Fin Mount Additions (FMAs) increase the aerodynamics of the fin assemblies by 40% according to hand calculations. The FMAs cover the fin mounts and smoothly interface with the base of the fins while minimizing any drag they contribute. Each FMA is directly attached at four points to the airframe. They were designed in SOLIDWORKS in collaboration with another subteam member. The FMAs were analyzed using Ansys Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and through manual calculations. They were fabricated using 3D-printing.
